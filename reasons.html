        <h1>(Mostly) Every Reason Why I love You</h1>
        <p> 
            <ol>
            <li>I love the way that you squeeze me closer when we're already hugging each other.</li>
            <li>I love sleeping next to you. It reminds me that I am loved.</li>
            <li>I love how much you love sleeping next to me. I feel so special that you would want to be with me even when you’re asleep.</li>
            <li>I love your massages— especially the guided meditation ones. </li>
            <li>I love that you let me do homework with your head in my lap. I can do my thing while I still get to be with the most amazing man in the world. </li>
            <li>I love that we have names for all of our cuddle positions.</li>
            <li>I love when you say that you’re day is going to get better just because you’re going to see me. I can’t tell you enough how special that makes me feel.</li>
            <li>I love that you got me Matelli. I love Matelli so much because Matelli is you. Even when I can’t be with you, I can hug the shit out of Matelli and pretend its you.</li>
            <li>I love your little snores when you fall asleep on your back. I’ve gotten very happy falling asleep to them.</li>
            <li>I love your twitches as you fall asleep. You’re so cute.</li>
            <li>I love how when I fall asleep you try to stay still for me when I start to twitch. In a weird way, it shows that you really care and want the best for me.</li>
            <li>I love when you cuddle and squeeze my head.</li>
            <li>I love the gifs we send when we miss each other. I feel like there are not many times to send gifs, but you’ve always provided me with the perfect opportunities.</li>
            <li>I love how you tell me when you’re sad and talk to me about your problems. It makes me feel needed and trusted. </li>
            <li>I love rubbing my nose against yours. Our noses were meant to be.</li>
            <li>I love kissing every part of your face. I don’t just love your lips. I love your nose, your eyes, your ears, your eyebrows, your chin, your forehead, and everything else about you.</li>
            <li>I love giving you head massages. It gives me the perfect time to show you how much I love you and play with your hair. I love the look on your face when you feel relaxed and cared for. </li>
            <li>I love that you think I’m a decent big spoon even though I’m just not. You even ask for it.</li>
            <li>I love that when we wake up you pull me back in and take another nap just holding me.</li>
            <li>I love that you plan how we’re going to spend time together when we’ve been apart. I love that you’re excited to be with me again, even if it’s only been a few days. You miss me and that makes me feel so loved.</li>
            <li>I love that you care about me so much even if you’re sad when I’m sad.</li>
            <li>I love that you watch tik toks with me while we rowboat. I love that I can feel it every time you laugh. </li>
            <li>I love that you watch rom-coms with me while we rowboat. I feel so loved with your arms around me or you kissing my head. </li>
            <li>I love that you let me climb up your back.</li>

            <li>I love that you understand that I'm not good at talking about things. You're so understanding and you never push me.</li>
            <li>I love that you bring me chocolate on my period. It makes me feel supported.</li>
            <li>I love that we can argue about things just for the debate. You keep me on my toes.</li>
            <li>I love that you always ask me if there’s anything you can change or do more of. You’re so mature and it is obvious that you really want us to work.</li>
            <li>I love that you hold me when I cry without saying anything. In a way, it makes me feel even more understood. It doesn’t matter the issue. You’ll be there to take care of me and love me.</li>
            <li>I love that you’re always happy to eat my leftovers. You perfectly compliment me. </li>
            <li>I love that we both love aquariums so much. We’re alike in so many ways.</li>
            <li>I love how handy you are. You’re my woodworking, MEAM 101, robotics, CIS guy. </li>
            <li>I love the puns and memes we send each other. They’re usually so bad but that makes it even funnier.</li>
            <li>I love how great of a friend you are. Not even as a boyfriend, you really are my best friend. We can laugh and fake fight about anything and at the end of the day, we’re still idiots just loving each other. </li>
            <li>I love how you try to listen to me and my stories. I know I tend to ramble and rant, but you always make an effort, even if it involves a ton of names and diagrams.</li>
            <li>I love doing face masks with you. I love that you enjoy it and don’t think it’s a super girly thing to do. You make it fun.</li>
            <li>I love when you roast me. I know, it’s weird. But you have to really know a person to be able to properly get under their skin. Plus, I love that we can joke around with each other and be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love when you make fun of me and try to make my faces of shock or intimidate my voice. It’s supposed to be annoying but it’s insanely cute. </li>
            <li>I love how you never want to make me feel uncomfortable and you respect me. You always ask for permission or my opinion and it shows that you truly care for me. </li>
            <li>I love playing heads up with you. We’re idiots (mostly me with the Albert Einstein one) but it’s always fun, even with your family.  </li>
            <li>I love that you didn’t give up when I said no to a date so many times. Update: okay, actually.  Sometimes I think about what would have happened if I kept turning you down and you gave up. Mush, you’re my everything. I can’t imagine how my life would be without you.</li>
            <li>I love that you answer all my “what if”s. You know I’m your little ball of stress and you always try to put my mind to ease. </li>
            <li>I love how excited you get about beer pong and ramen. It’s hot when you get all cute and excited. </li>
            <li>I love the diagrams you draw me in iMessage. They’re so cute and honestly do add value to understanding what you’re talking about. </li>
            <li>I love how we have the same taste in desserts. It’s very important that we can agree that BJ’s cake is amazing and that the NYC Apple Pie is a must-have. </li>
            <li>I love how much fun we have watching turtles and cuddling in Central Park. I can always take you my favorite places and you appreciate it.</li>
            <li>I love that you plan the day with me even though you don’t like planning. You’re always willing to approach things my way and see my side.  </li>
            <li>I love that you have every aspect and more that I’ve ever wanted in a boyfriend. You check boxes I didn’t know I had.</li>
            <li>I love how sweet your family is and how welcoming they were. You know my family situation and it means a lot that they cared about me.</li>
            <li>I love how we say the same thing at the same time so often (we’re the same).</li>
            <li>I love that you remembered my name after the arboretum. I love how you wished that you had gotten my snap.  </li>
            <li>I love that you could vibe at my Indian parties. It doesn’t matter that you couldn’t understand the songs or even the drinks, you just tried to fit in for me.</li>

            <li>I love that you always save the yellow flavors of candy for me.</li>
            <li>I love how you laughed off when I got my period after sex. You knew I was so embarrassed and just wanted to make me feel better.</li>
            <li>I love that you ask me if I want anything whenever you go to Wawa. I love that you get me candy even when I say I don’t.  </li>
            <li>I love that you’re always willing to help me with any assignment, no matter how tired you are or how boring the class.</li>
            <li>I love that you always think I’m smart, even when I’ve done something dumb or received a bad grade. You’re my biggest fan.</li>
            <li>I love that you’re always so patient to answer all my hw questions. You want me to succeed and to truly learn and understand. </li>
            <li>I love that you know when I’m stressed and do everything you can to stop it. </li>
            <li>I love that you helped me move without complaining even once. I would have felt so alone and helpless without you, but you always have my back. </li>
            <li>I love that you answered me every time I asked if your parents were okay with me staying with you (which was many).</li>
            <li>I love that you always offer to get me food when I’m hungry. You want me to be healthy and safe. </li>
            <li>I love that you want to work on projects with me. I feel honored that you think of me as a worthy, intelligent partner.</li>
            <li>I love that you were so proud of me every time I got something right in C++. It made me want to learn more and make you proud.</li>
            <li>I love that you snap draw outfits onto me when I can’t go shopping. That was absolutely so cute. </li>

            <li>I love that you believe in me.</li>
            <li>I love that you don’t get annoyed when I don’t understand something. You always try to explain it again until I understand.</li>

            <li>I love that you were the first one I got to eat in my dining room with. I felt like grown-ups playing house.</li>
            <li>I love that you like maggi and let me drink the broth. You like what I don’t and I like what you don’t.</li>
            <li>I love that you like NCIS. I feel like not many kids our age know the show and it was a big part of my childhood.</li>
            <li>I love playing Bloons Tower Defense with you. It’s so much fun and you get so excited to tell me about all the towers and to gain XP. We’re truly partners and work well together. </li>

            <li>I love that you bring me Tylenol to my class when I’m on my period. You have no idea what that means and how sweet it is. It makes a huge difference and I would’ve sat there in pain without you. I also appreciate how persistent you were about doing it, even though I kept insisting that I was fine. You knew I wasn’t and wanted to make me happy.</li>

            <li>I love how you’re so excited to introduce me to your friends. I feel honored that you want your friends to know me. </li>
            <li>I love that you make an effort to invite Alisha to things. I know you do it because you care about me. </li>

            <li>I love that you always think I look hot. Always. Even when I very much do not. I love that you then try to convince me I am.

            <li>I love that you tried to write me a love letter. I love that you googled how to. </li>

            <li>I love how much effort you put into the jewelry box. I also love the jewelry box. You knew I needed one and put so much thought into it.</li>
            <li>I love how you play with my hair. It makes me feel so relaxed and loved.</li>
            <li>I love when you sing mountain mama to me as a lullaby. I’ve never had a song with someone before.

            <li>I love that you can’t take your eyes off of me at parties. Mateo, I have no way to describe how amazing it makes me feel, like I’m your dream girl and no one else matters. It’s the look in rom coms that every girl only dreams of.</li>
            <li>I love that you get sad when I talk about changing majors. It makes me feel like I actually make a difference in your life and that not having me around as much would make you sad.  </li>
            <li>I love that you were so excited to live with me for the week. Most guys would be scared or want their privacy, but you made me feel so welcomed and wanted. </li>
            <li>I love that you dressed up to meet my brother. You care about making me happy and making a good impression. </li>

            <li>I loved playing soccer with you and Malena (even though you two were clearly letting me win).</li>
            <li>I love that you made me a crossword puzzle and took the time to make every clue so sweet. It made me feel like you know so many little things about me and that you truly want to make me happy and show me that you care.</li>
            <li>I love that you write me letters to read when you can’t be with me. The “read when” letters make me feel so incredibly loved and cared for. No one has ever done something that sweet for me and I can’t thank you enough for trying to make my quarantine better. You knew I was sad and you would do anything to make me feel better.</li>

            <li>I love the creases that form near your eyes when you smile.</li>
            <li>I love your beautiful green eyes. They’re mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>I love that you’re willing to try new sex stuff with me. It’s always either super hot or super funny. I always feel so comfortable around you. </li>
            <li>I love when you shower with me. You take extra time to make sure <em>every</em> part of me is clean. </li>

            <li>I love that you’re always telling me how much you love my blowjobs. You know I don’t love giving them all the time and it makes me feel really appreciated when you praise them. It makes me want to do it more so that I can make you happy. </li>
            <li>I love that you're working on your abs and muscles. You're so hot and I'm happy that you're trying to be healthy.</li>
